## Purpose
This repo is meant to house my ongoing work toward the ProjectEuler100 challenge and contains notes and code for each of the problems that I've attempted or am working on. These problems are being attempted for personal skill development and aren't part of any other projects or software I'm currently developing.

Anyone reviewing this repo who is also working on the project is welcome to contact me via email at themidnightcompiler@gmail.com or on Twitter using @midnightCompile.


## Background
For those unaware of the Challenge, [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) has challenged developers to expand their thinking and hone algorithm development and mathematical skills by taking part in a challenge based on completing problems posted on [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about). 

Essentially, the website serves as a platform to allow individuals who are interested furthering their problem solving skills to explore new realms of thought by solving mathmatically based problems. 

FreeCodeCamp has challenged developers to complete the first 100 problems posted on ProjectEuler. These are supposed to be completed sequentially, and along the way certain rules are in place to inspire communication with other developers working through the challenge.


## Resources
[ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about) - This is the platform hosting the challenges for ProjectEuler100. Membership is completely free and highly impersonal- they doen't even require you to provide email/phone/other info.

[FreeCodeCamp's ProjectEuler100 Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) - Here is the page posted on FreeCodeCamp's site outlining the challenge instructions.


## Problems
This is a list of the problems I've attempted thus far:

001. Multiples of 3 and 5 -- [Solution](001_multiples_of_3_and_5.py) -- [Notes](001_multiples_of_3_and_5_notes.md)
002. Even Fibonacci Numbers -- [Solution](002_even_fibonacci_numbers.py) -- [Notes](002_even_fibonacci_numbers_notes.md)
003. Largest Prime Factor -- [Solution](003_largest_prime_factor.py) -- [Notes](003_largest_prime_factor_notes.md)
004. Largest Palindrome Project -- (In Development)
